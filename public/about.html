<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate and dedicated backend developer with a strong educational background in Computer Science and Cloud Computing. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and recently completed my Master’s in Cloud Computing from the UK. My academic journey has equipped me with solid programming skills, hands-on experience in building secure and scalable applications, and a deep understanding of modern technologies like AWS, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. I am highly interested in designing robust backend systems, exploring new technologies, and continuously learning to deliver reliable solutions. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and enjoy working on projects that make a real-world impact.

<p>Beyond coding, I have a deep love for learning new things and exploring innovative ideas. I enjoy reading about the latest trends in technology and cloud solutions. In my free time, I love cooking and trying out new recipes, which helps me relax and stay creative. I also enjoy writing and sharing my knowledge with others, whether through simple explanations or helpful posts. I believe in continuous growth and like to spend time reflecting on how I can improve both professionally and personally.</p>
